          作文
          １、
        My ideal job  (我理想的工作)
        I have been dreamed to be a teacher since I was a kid. Everyday when I arrived at school, my lovely teacher would give me a warm hug with a big shining smile. It made me felt like a flower which had been taken good care by the gardener and I felt comfortable. Not only me, but also the other kids had the same feeling, and this feeling helped us grow happy and healthy. So I thought, teacher was such a job that full of significance. I do should be a teacher.  I have studied so hard since then, and I believe the solid basis of the job is build on it. I will stick to my faith and work even harder. I believe my dream will come ture sooner or later.
        2,Talking About Myself(自我介绍)
        My name is Holly. I’m 37years old. I’m from Ningxia. I’m a math teacher in a primary school. My school is far away from my home. So I usually take the bus to work. There are three people in my family .They are my wife, my daughter and I. My wife is a doctor in a big hospital and my daughter is a ten-year-old pupil. In my spare time, I like reading books, watching TV, playing table
        tennis and so on. I used to fishing in the weekends, but I don’t now,  because I have to attend class in the TV University.
        3,My Family（我的家庭）
          There are five persons in my family, my parents, my wife, my daughter and I. My father used to
        be a senior engineer. His responsibility was designing new machines. My mother would work in a factory. They are retired now. My father is very serious about everything in life and pays attention
        to the details. My mother is patient and hardworking. I take after my parents. They have influence upon me to make me a good teacher. My wife is a nurse and she is very busy everyday. My daughter is a pupil. She is pretty and lovely and looks like her mother.
        4,My Family Life
        （我的家庭生活）
          Like most ordinary Chinese families, my family life is busy and meaningful. My family members often get up at about six o’clock in the mornings. My wife deals with my little kid, while I’m cooking the breakfast. I drive my daughter to her school and then to my work. My wife takes the subway to her hospital. Around 4:30 p.m., I pick up my daughter and do some grocery shopping. My wife is good at cooking. So when we arrive home, a delicious meal is waiting for us. During the eating, we chat about interesting things from our daily life and discuss current affairs. We go to bed at 10 p.m.

        5,Changes in My Life（我生活中的变化）
          There have been many changes in my life. With the development of the economy, my
        life is better off. For clothing, I have spare money to buy sorts of pretty clothes. But in the past, there were fewer clothes in my wardrobe. For food, I usually had traditional Chinese food for every meal, rice, noodles or a steamed bun with one or two light dishes such as preserved pickles. Nowadays, I can afford any delicious food, including western foods. For housing, I have moved from a cramped and gloomy room to a big and bright flat. For getting around, I rode an old bike on my way to work a year ago. At present, I drive my private car to travel. I believe my life will be better and better in the future.
        6,My Home（我的家）
          I am living on the 10th floor of a tower building with my wife and daughter. It is a newly-built block of flats with 22 stories altogether in the north of the city. We have three bedrooms, one big living-room, one kitchen and two bathrooms. The size is about 127 square meters. When we moved in three years ago. I painted the doors myself, but I had the window frames painted. We are satisfied with the decorations except the cupboards in the kitchen, so I need to build them again. The neighborhood is nice too. I think my home is cozy and I like my home.
        7,My Hobbies
        （我的业余爱好）
          Hobbies are activities from which one can benefit a lot. In my spare time, I like painting, singing, raising flowers and cycling. My hobbies help me relax after periods of hard work. Moreover, I can make many friends who share the same hobbies with me. My hobbies help me maintain a mental and physical balance. As you can see, hobbies can be relaxing, challenging, interesting, enjoyable or educational. So everyone should have one or two hobbies, then the life
        is meaningful and amusing.
        8,My Favorite Sport
        （我喜爱的运动）

        My favorite sport is swimming. There are three reasons why I like the sport best.  First, it is good for keeping fit. It benefits the heart, the lungs(肺) and the limbs(四肢). Thanks to the sport, I lost
        my weight and am graceful in form. Second, it is easy to find a place to swim. In the country, I can swim in lakes and rivers. In the city, there are many swimming pools spotted among the residential areas. Third, it can be done in any weather. It is very cool swimming in hot summer. In cold weather, swimming is especially refreshing. Swimming is a very popular sport. I hope you can enjoy it too.
        9,Health and Eating Habit
        （健康与饮食习惯）

        An eating habit is closely related to health. In order to keep fit, we should pay more attention to our eating habits. My suggestions for a good eating habit are as follows.  First, don’t eat too much or too little for each meal. Eating too much will cause overweight and eating too little,
        malnutrition(营养不良).  Second, don’t eat between meals. Sometimes we like eating biscuits and chips before the mealtime, as a result, we lose our appetite(胃口) for lunch or dinner.  Third, eat more vegetables and fruits everyday.  In my opinion, a good eating habit leads to a healthy life.
        10,How to Keep Healthy
        （如何保持身体健康)
        Nowadays, more and more people know the importance of keeping healthy. Without good health, we can do nothing. For me, there are mainly three ways to keep healthy.  First, it is necessary to keep a balanced diet, which is the basis of good health. We should have plenty of fruits and
        vegetables everyday.  Secondly, it is important to do regular exercises, such as swimming, jogging and so on. Last but not least, it is essential to keep in good spirits. Relaxation and entertainment are ways to renew our spirits and release our stress.  When we make healthy habits a part of our everyday life, we are bound to keep healthy.
        11,High School Life and College Life
        （我的大学生活）
        High school life is quite different from college life. In high school, the students have to wear school uniform. Teachers always ask students to do many tasks in the classroom and supervise students’ behavior in detail. In college, students have to be responsible for themselves. They have more freedom in college than in high school. For example, they put on the casual clothes instead of uniform. Tutors give them lectures and assignments, and they must spend more time studying by themselves in the library. That means students must manage themselves very well. Although I often recall my high school life, I like college life more.

        12,My TV University Life
        （我的电大生活）

        Our TV University is mainly engaged in long distance education. The form of study is very convenient for adult learners like me. I can learn my courses anywhere in my spare time by computer. There are many web-based courses and sources on line. Moreover, I not only use e-mail to send our homework to our tutors but also join online discussion forums. Meantime,
        the difficulties and puzzles can be solved in the tutorial once a week. The e-learning life is meaningful and demanding. I enjoy my TV university life.
        13,Living in a Big City
        （城市生活）

        In the eyes of many people, city life is attractive with all its advantages and conveniences. People can buy almost all kinds of things at supermarkets or shopping malls, dine out in good restaurants, and more important, they can have more educational opportunities.  However, with the expansion of the city, more and more people are flowing into the big city, the traffic is heavier and heavier, the pollution is more and more serious, and the living condition is worse and worse.  Most people love the advantages of city life, but a big city also has its disadvantages.

        14,Help For Elderly People
        （爱护老人）
          It is reported that China has stepped into an aging society. As the aging of the population quickens, the number of elderly people is becoming very large. Therefore, it is necessary to find good ways to deal with the problem.  According to traditional Chinese moral values, it is the sons or daughters who should take the responsibility of caring their elderly parents. The youth should not only look after their elderly parents in material terms but also understand their loneliness and do their best to spend more time with them.  But because the family plan has been carried out for many years in China, it is a common picture that a young couple has to support four elderly
        parents. This trend will reach its peak in coming years. The government is responsible for guaranteeing the basic living standards of the elderly and safeguard (保护) their legitimate (合法的) rights and interests and establish a multi-level old-age insurance system.

        15,My English Studies
        （我的英语学习）
          I have been learning English for more than twenty years. Recalling my English studies, I would like to share some good ways and some frustrations with you.  First, I am independent in English studies. Instead of waiting for the teacher to explain, I try to find the patterns and rules on my own.  Second, I am an active English learner. I never wait for a chance using English. I
        look for such a chance, and create a language environment by myself. I am willing to make mistakes and not afraid of losing face.  Try your best to enjoy the pleasure of English studies, bear in mind that “frustration gets you nowhere”

        Once the king of India fell ill and sent for his doctor. The doctor came, examined him and said, “You will be well again in a few days if you take bull’s milk.” The king was

        very surprised, for he had never heard of a bull that gave milk. “How is it possible?” he asked.

        “Order Gulbo, the scholar, to get it for you. He can do anything.” The doctor was an enemy to Gulbo, and thought this would be a way of making him suffer. When the king told Gulbo what the doctor had said and ordered him to get bull’s milk, Gulbo immediately understood what the doctor was trying to do.

        When he got home he sat thinking how to get out of the difficulties. His daughter, seeing him worried, asked what was the matter. On hearing what the king had asked for, she said, “Don’t worry, father, I’ll help you.”

        The next day she took some old clothes, went to the bank of the river near the palace, and chose a place below the king’s bedroom window. In the middle of the night, when everyone was in bed, she started to do her washing. She made so much noise that the king could not sleep. The king got very angry and set a guard to find out what was the matter. The soldier found the girl, and led her to the king. “Why do you wash your clothes here at night?” asked the king.

        The girl pretended to be afraid and said, “I had to wash clothes at night. This afternoon my father had a baby. I was busy all day because of that. Then I found there were no clean clothes for the baby, so I had to come and wash them now.” “What!” cried the king, “Are you trying to make a fool of me? Who ever heard of a man having a baby?”

        “Well, if the king himself orders someone to get bull’s milk for him, why can’t a man have a baby?”

        The king smiled and said, “You must be Gulbo’s daughter. Go and tell your father that he may keep the bull’s milk for his baby.”

        1. According to the doctor in the story, the king’s illness can be cured by ______.
        A. making Gulbo suffer
        B. drinking bull’s milk
        C. seeing another doctor
        D. feeding him with cow’s milk
        2. The doctor told the king to ask Gulbo to find bull’s milk because he ______.
        A. admired Gulbo greatly
        B. hated Gulbo very much
        C. thought Gulbo was a scholar
        D. tried to make Gulbo another doctor
        3. How did Gulbo feel after getting the king’s order?

        B. He was excited.
        C. He was surprised.
        D. He was disappointed.
        4. Why did Gulbo’s daughter wash clothes below the king’s bedroom window at night?

        B. Because she often washed clothes there.
        C. Because she enjoyed washing clothes there.
        D. Because she wanted the king to notice her.

        People all over the world today are beginning to hear and learn more and more about the problem of pollution. Pollution is caused either by man’s release of completely new and often artificial (人造的) substances into the environment, or by releasing greatly increased amounts of a natural substance (物质)，such as oil from oil tankers into the sea.

        Whatever its underlying reasons, there is no doubt that much of the pollution caused could be controlled if only companies, individuals and governments would make more efforts. In the home there is an obvious need to control litter and waste. Food comes wrapped up three of four times in packages that all have to be disposed of; drinks are increasingly sold in bottles or tins which can’t be reused. This not only causes a litter problem, but also is a great waste of resources, in terms of glass, metal and paper. Advertising has helped this process by persuading many of us not only to buy things we neither want nor need, but also to throw away much of what we do buy. Pollution and waste combine to be a problem everyone can help to solve by cutting out unnecessary buying, excess use and careless disposal (处理) of the products we use in our daily lives.

        1. The main cause of pollution is __________.
        A. the release of artificial or natural substances into the environment
        B. the production of new industrial goods
        C. increased amounts of a natural substance
        D. our ever-increasing population
        2. Much of the pollution could be controlled if only __________.
        A. people would pay more attention to the problem
        B. governments would take effective measures
        C. all sides concerned would make more efforts
        D. farmers would use less artificial fertilizers
        3. Food packages, bottles and tins for drinks can cause __________.
        A. air and water pollution
        B. both a litter problem and a waster of resources
        C. to pay for the service
        D. to produce the receipt
        4. Which of the following can not help solving the problem of pollution?
        A. Cutting out unnecessary buying.
        B. Eating.
        C. Reduce excess use.
        D. Carefully dispose our daily products.
        5. What does the underlined word “litter” mean in paragraph 2?
        A. not many
        B. serious problem
        C. bits of waste things
        D. industrial pollution

        Thousands of years ago, in the middle of an ocean, miles from the nearest island, an undersea volcano broke out. The hot liquid piled higher and higher and spread wider and wider. In this way, an island rose up in the sea.

        As time went on, hot sun and cool rains made the rock split and break to pieces. Sea waves dashed against the rock. In this way, soil and sand came into being.

        Nothing lived on the naked soil. And then the wind and birds brought plant seeds, spiders and other little creatures there. Only plants could grow first. Only they, in sunlight, could produce food from the minerals of the soil, water and air. While many animals landed on the island, they could find no food. A spider spun its web in vain, because there were no insects for its web to catch. Insects couldn’t stay until there were plants for them to eat. So plants had to be the pioneer life on this new island.


        1. The passage centers on __________.

        E. how an undersea volcano broke out
        F. how an island rose up in the sea
        G. how soil was formed on a new island
        H. how life began on a volcano-produced island
        2.According to the passage, the island got its first soil from __________.
        A. sea waves
        B. the sand brought by the wind
        C. its own rock
        D. cool rains
        3.The word “naked” (in para. 3) could be replaced by which of the following?
        A. hidden
        B. new
        C. mysterious
        D. bare
        4.The order of coming into being on the island is __________.
        A. soil, plants and animals
        B. soil, little creatures and plants
        C. soil, birds and plants
        D. soil, human beings and animals
        5. According to the passage, which of the following is TRUE ?
        A. Spiders were the first life that could live on the island.
        B. The island is far away from any piece of land.
        C. Insects could not live on the island without plants.
        D. Plants were brought to the island by human being.

        In the last 500 years, nothing about people – not their clothes, ideas, or languages – has changed as much as what they eat. The original chocolate drink was made from the seeds of the cocoa tree by South American Indians. The Spanish introduced it to the rest of the world during the 1500’s. And although it was very expensive, it quickly became fashionable. In London shops where chocolate drinks were served became important meeting places. Some still exist today.

        The potato is also from the New World. Around 1600, the Spanish brought it from Peru to Europe, where it soon was widely grown. Ireland became so dependent on it that thousands of Irish people starved when the crop failed during the“Potato Famine”of 1845-6, and thousands more were forced to emigrate to America.

        There are many other foods that have traveled from South America to the Old World. But some others went in the opposite direction. Brazil is now the World’s largest grower of coffee, and coffee is an important crop in Colombia and other South American countries. But it is native to Ethiopia. It was first made into a drink by Arabs during the 1400’s.

        According to an Arabic legend, coffee was discovered when a goatherd name Kaldi noticed that his goats were attracted to the red berries on a coffee bush. He tried one and experienced the “wide-awake” feeling that one-third of the world’s population now starts the day with.

        1. According to the passage, which of the following has changed the most in the last
        500 years?
        A. Food C. Potato
        B. Chocolate D. Coffee
        2. “Some” in “Some still exist today” means _________.
        A. some cocoa trees C. some shops
        B. some chocolate drinks D. some South American Indians
        3. Thousands of Irish people starved during the “Potato Famine” because _________.
        A. they were so dependent on the potato that they refused to eat anything else
        B. they were forced to emigrate to America
        C. the weather conditions in Ireland were not suitable for growing the potato
        D. the potato harvest was bad
        4. Coffee originally came from_________.
        A. Brazil

        Crime Prevention Initiatives

        The chances that you will be a victim of violent crime are low. But you can avoid risk in the following ways.

        AT HOME

        • You should make sure your house or flat is secure. Always lock the door from the inside at night, but you must keep the key nearby, so that you can use it to get out quickly if there is a fire.

        • You must never give keys to workmen as they can easily make copies.

        • If you wake up and hear a burglar, stay quietly in bed. Pretend you are asleep. If you feel more confident, switch on the light and make a lot of noise; even if you are on your own you should call out loudly to an imaginary companion, so that the burglar thinks you are not alone and runs away. You should have a phone or a mobile in your bedroom to alert the police immediately.

        • If you come home and think you see signs of a break-in, you shouldn’t go in, the burglar may be inside. You should go to a neighbour and call the police
        ON THE STREET
        At night:
        • Always walk facing the traffic, so that a car cannot pull up behind you. • You mustn’t go through parks or woods.
        • If you think someone is following you, cross the road one or two times. If he or she continues to follow you, go to a pub or other public place.
        • Always carry your bag close to you, but carry your house keys in your pocket so that you can open the door quickly. If someone attacks you - remember your safety is more important than your property.

        An Extraordinary Change of Direction
        Molly Wilson had been a dancer and a mother for many years when she decided to sail round the world to raise money for charity.
        As a child she had trained as a ballet dancer, but at 15 she had grown too tall for classical ballet, so she became a member of a pop dance team.
        She got married, and after she had children she retired from show business to bring them up. They grew up, and when they were 18 they left home.
        She says, “When I decided to do the round-the-world race, my husband thought I was bored because the children had left home. He was also worried because I had never sailed before. I was not bored, but I had met some people who told me about the race.
        They had taken part in it, but they had only done one section, say, from New Zealand to Australia. I wanted to do the whole ten-month journey.”
        Before Molly left she did a lot of training, but it hadn’t prepared her for the worst weather which they experienced. She tells one story. “One night the sea was very rough and it was very cold. I had gone downstairs when a huge wave smashed into the boat and injured two men on the deck. One of the men couldn’t move because he had broken his leg. They were taken to hospital by helicopter. That was the worst time.”
        By the end of October last year, she had raised more than £50,000 for charity.
        She says, “Sometimes I ask myself, what did I do? How did I do it? But then I think, it’s the same as being a dancer. Before I left on the trip, I had trained hard. I had got very fit and had prepared myself completely. Then on the trip I was simply a good team member.”

        1. What does the word “extraordinary” mean in the title?
        A. very ordinary
        B. very unusual and surprising
        C. not special
        D. extreme
        2. The sentence “…my husband thought I was bored …” in Para. 4 meant that my husband thought I felt_________.
        A. dissatisfied because I had nothing better to do at home
        B. annoyed because I had to wait long for my children to come back home
        C. happy because I could do something I was interested in instead of taking care of children
        D. sad because all the children left me when they grew up
        3. The word “section” in Para. 4 most probably means here _________.
        A. group of people
        B. part of the training
        C. part of the route of sail
        D. part of the job

        4. Which of the following is nearest (closest) in meaning to “rough” in the sentence “One night the sea was very rough …” in Para. 5?
        A. not exact
        B. difficult
        C. not smooth because of huge waves
        D. pleasant

        5. The last paragraph suggests that _________.
        A. the qualities she needed for the trip were the same as those for a dancer
        B. many years of dancing had already prepared her for the sail completely, so she needn’t do anything before the journey
        C. she should be kind to other team members during the trip
        D. she should not forget dancing during the trip

        There have been changes in all sorts of different areas of British society. In recent years in the UK we have had a very large increase in the number of couples who get divorced.

        After 1969 and the Divorce Law Reform Act we had a very rapid increase in the number of divorces. The rate increased steadily and in recent years has increased much more rapidly. But there are also quite a lot of people who do actually get married. At present the marriage rate in the UK is about 70 per cent, which has gone down since the number of people who marry has gone down quite a lot in the last 20 years, but more significantly in the last 10 years. Quite high proportions of people now live together without marrying, and, for example, 40 per cent of children born in the UK are born to couples who aren't married or are born to lone parents. There are quite a large number of lone parent families, 90 per cent of these are headed by a woman rather than a man.

        The average family size now in the UK is 1.8 children per couple, which means that there's been quite a decline in the birth rate in the UK along with other European countries.

        1. What does the passage mainly discuss? C

        Some people think they have an answer to the troubles of automobile crowding and dirty air in large cities. Their answer is the bicycle, or “bike”.
        In a great many cities, hundreds of people ride bicycles to work every day. In New York City, some bike riders have even formed a group called Bike for a Better City. They claim that if more people rode bicycles to work there would be fewer automobiles in the downtown section of the city and therefore less dirty air from car engines.

        For several years this group has been trying to get the city government to help bike riders. For example, they want the city to draw bicycle lanes on some of the main streets, because when bike riders have to use the same lanes as cars, there are accidents. Bike for a Better City feels that if there were special lanes more people would use bikes.

        But no bicycle lanes have been drawn. Not everyone thinks it is a good idea - they say it will slow traffic. Some store owners on the main streets say that if there is less traffic, they will have less business. And most people live too far from downtown to travel by bike.

        The city government has not yet decided what to do. It wants to keep everyone happy. Only on weekends, Central Park is closed to cars, and the roads may be used by bicycles only. But Bike for a Better City says that this is not enough and keeps fighting to get bicycle lanes downtown.

        1. According to the passage, bicycles _____D_______.
        A. are more convenient than cars
        B. are safer traffic tools than cars
        C. are ridden by most people in the U.S
        D. are the solution to some city problems
        2. The idea of special bicycle lanes is most favored by __B__________. E. the city government
        F. some bike riders
        G. people living far from downtown
        H. some store owners
        3. “Bicycle lanes” in the third paragraph probably means __C__________. I. narrow passages between buildings for bicycles
        J. roads full of bicycles
        K. special parts of the road for bicycle riders only
        L. roads for bicycles only
        4. Which of the following is not true according to the passage? D
        M. Bike for a Better City members ride bicycles to work.
        N. Sometimes accidents may occur when cars and bikes are on the same lanes. O. The Central Park is closed to cars on weekends.
        P. In New York City, many people use bikes as they have special lanes.
        5. The best title for this passage is _ D
        ___________.
        Q. Traffic Crowding in New York City
        R. Air Pollution in New York City by Cars
        S. Special Lanes for Passengers
        T. Solution to Traffic Problem in New York

        “Get up, the water is coming.” Yan Xinzhi, director of the neighborhood committee of Chaoyang Street, Taiyuan, capital of Shanxi Province, would knock at the door of every household at midnight to have people collect water; otherwise, the tap water would soon run dry when everyone in the city got up and joined the “water rush” in the morning. Yan, an elderly lady about 60, had served as committee director for more than 20 years; her major work was to rouse her neighbors from their sleep to get water. As time went by, residents could not go to sleep before one o’clock in the morning.
        Chaoyang Street was not the only street in Taiyuan that lacked water, and Taiyuan was not the only city in China with water in short supply.
        Niu Maosheng, Minister of Water Resources, told China Today that more than 300
        cities nationwide lack water; in 108 cities the situation has become critical. The annual deficit of water has reached 6 billion cubic meters, leading to a loss of RMB 200 billion (approximately US $24 billion) in industrial output.
        1. As neighborhood committee director, the major part of Yan Xinzhi’s job was to wake up her neighbors at midnight to get water. T
        2. The passage reveals that all the cities in China suffer from water shortage. F

        People who cannot tell all colors apart are said to be color blind. Most color-blind people can see yellow and blues, but confuse reds with greens. It is very rare for a person to be blind to all colors, but they may see everything in shades of black, white, and gray.
        It is interesting to note that many color-blind people don’t even realize that they are color-blind. They don’t know that the colors they are seeing and naming are not the actual colors that people with normal vision can see. This can be particularly dangerous when a color-blind person confuses the red and green of a traffic light. Color blindness is thought to be inherited (遗传). And although doctors have thought up tests to determine（测定）color blindness, there is no cure to treatment for it.
        1. A color-blind person can tell correctly red and green.
        2. Many color-blind people are unaware (没意识到) that they are color-blind.
        3. It’s especially dangerous for a color-blind person to cross a street when there are no traffic lights at the cross of the streets.
        4. A person who is color-blind is not allowed to drive.
        5. Up to now, doctors have found a way to free a person from his color blindness. F T F NG F
        Lily is 70 years old and she takes care of her 91-year-old mother. She told us about caring for her mother.

        I wake up early every day, it’s usually about 6.30 am, and wait until I hear Tilly, my mum, moving about. Then I make her a cup of tea. At about half past seven she gets up and we have breakfast together. We normally just have toast, but on Sundays we always have bacon and eggs. After breakfast she reads the newspaper, then she sits by the window and waves to the neighbours as they walk by.
        She hardly ever goes out but she is very proud of her personal appearance, so she goes to the hairdresser once a month.
        She doesn’t like being left on her own for very long, so I always arrange for a neighbour to come and sit with her when I go out. Now and again, my friend and
        neighbour, Joan, comes to spend the day with her, and I can go and have lunch with another friend, May, who lives in town.
        I have a brother, Syd. He comes to stay two or three times a year. He is very good and keeps in touch, but he lives 300 miles away. Once a year, he collects mum and takes her to stay with him in London for a week. She doesn’t really like going because it’s a long journey, but I need the rest.
        Sally, the nurse, comes to see mum regularly. My next-door neighbour, Jack, often calls in. In the evening we usually watch TV and we sometimes play cards. Mum is fantastic for her age. But I can never decide to go anywhere spontaneously. I always have to plan it, so I feel a bit trapped. But what is the alternative? An old people’s home? I couldn’t do that to my mother.

        1. Lily wakes before her mother.
        2. Tilly is satisfied with her hairdresser.
        3. Joan sometimes spends the day with Lily's mother.
        4. Lily's brother comes to visit every three weeks.
        5. Lily and her mother play cards more than they watch TV.

        Benjamin Disraeli, the famous nineteenth century prime minister, said, “London is not a city, it is a nation.” Today this is an understatement; London, with its vast range of different ethnic groups, is a world.
        Certainly, London is the most culturally diverse city in the world. The city was founded by the Romans and since then new arrivals have constantly added to its character and prosperity.
        Within 10 years 40% of Londoners will be from ethnic minority groups, including the growing number of Londoners of mixed ethnic origin, but most of them will have been born in Britain. Children of Caribbean-Chinese marriages will go to school with children of Russian-Irish couples. None of them will be English, but all of them will be Londoners.
        Most of Britain's ethnic minority residents live in the capital, speaking over 300 languages. Nearly all of the African population and many of the Caribbean population of Britain live in London (83% and 58% respectively); 39% of the Chinese population of Britain and 36% of the Asian population of Britain live in London. The largest migrant community is from the Irish Republic with 256,000 people, 3.8% of the total population of London.
        There are an estimated 330,000 refugees and asylum seekers living in London, with most recent arrivals coming from Eastern Europe, North Africa and Kurdistan.
        Young people, in particular, are skilled at dealing with a large number of different and
        hybrid cultures. They themselves often have several different ethnic identities since their parents and grandparents may come from several different backgrounds, and their friends and partners do also. They are “skilled cross-cultural travellers” without leaving their home-town.
        1. London is a nation.
        2. The city of London was founded by the Romans.
        3. All African population live in London.
        4. 39% of the total population of London are Chinese.
        5. Old people are also “skilled cross-cultural travelers”.

We have three bedrooms, one big living-room, one kitchen and two bathrooms. The size is about 127 square meters. When we moved in three years ago. I painted the doors myself, but I had the window frames painted. We are satisfied with the decorations except the cupboards in the kitchen, so I need to build them again. The neighborhood is nice too. I think my home is cozy and I like my home.
      7,My Hobbies
      （我的业余爱好）
        Hobbies are activities from which one can benefit a lot. In my spare time, I like painting, singing, raising flowers and cycling. My hobbies help me relax after periods of hard work. Moreover, I can make many friends who share the same hobbies with me. My hobbies help me maintain a mental and physical balance. As you can see, hobbies can be relaxing, challenging, interesting, enjoyable or educational. So everyone should have one or two hobbies, then the life
      is meaningful and amusing.
      8,My Favorite Sport
      （我喜爱的运动）

      My favorite sport is swimming. There are three reasons why I like the sport best.  First, it is good for keeping fit. It benefits the heart, the lungs(肺) and the limbs(四肢). Thanks to the sport, I lost
      my weight and am graceful in form. Second, it is easy to find a place to swim. In the country, I can swim in lakes and rivers. In the city, there are many swimming pools spotted among the residential areas. Third, it can be done in any weather. It is very cool swimming in hot summer. In cold weather, swimming is especially refreshing. Swimming is a very popular sport. I hope you can enjoy it too.
      9,Health and Eating Habit
      （健康与饮食习惯）

      An eating habit is closely related to health. In order to keep fit, we should pay more attention to our eating habits. My suggestions for a good eating habit are as follows.  First, don’t eat too much or too little for each meal. Eating too much will cause overweight and eating too little,
      malnutrition(营养不良).  Second, don’t eat between meals. Sometimes we like eating biscuits and chips before the mealtime, as a result, we lose our appetite(胃口) for lunch or dinner.  Third, eat more vegetables and fruits everyday.  In my opinion, a good eating habit leads to a healthy life.
      10,How to Keep Healthy
      （如何保持身体健康)
      Nowadays, more and more people know the importance of keeping healthy. Without good health, we can do nothing. For me, there are mainly three ways to keep healthy.  First, it is necessary to keep a balanced diet, which is the basis of good health. We should have plenty of fruits and
      vegetables everyday.  Secondly, it is important to do regular exercises, such as swimming, jogging and so on. Last but not least, it is essential to keep in good spirits. Relaxation and entertainment are ways to renew our spirits and release our stress.  When we make healthy habits a part of our everyday life, we are bound to keep healthy.
      11,High School Life and College Life
      （我的大学生活）
      High school life is quite different from college life. In high school, the students have to wear school uniform. Teachers always ask students to do many tasks in the classroom and supervise students’ behavior in detail. In college, students have to be responsible for themselves. They have more freedom in college than in high school. For example, they put on the casual clothes instead of uniform. Tutors give them lectures and assignments, and they must spend more time studying by themselves in the library. That means students must manage themselves very well. Although I often recall my high school life, I like college life more.

      12,My TV University Life
      （我的电大生活）

      Our TV University is mainly engaged in long distance education. The form of study is very convenient for adult learners like me. I can learn my courses anywhere in my spare time by computer. There are many web-based courses and sources on line. Moreover, I not only use e-mail to send our homework to our tutors but also join online discussion forums. Meantime,
      the difficulties and puzzles can be solved in the tutorial once a week. The e-learning life is meaningful and demanding. I enjoy my TV university life.
      13,Living in a Big City
      （城市生活）

      In the eyes of many people, city life is attractive with all its advantages and conveniences. People can buy almost all kinds of things at supermarkets or shopping malls, dine out in good restaurants, and more important, they can have more educational opportunities.  However, with the expansion of the city, more and more people are flowing into the big city, the traffic is heavier and heavier, the pollution is more and more serious, and the living condition is worse and worse.  Most people love the advantages of city life, but a big city also has its disadvantages.

      14,Help For Elderly People
      （爱护老人）
        It is reported that China has stepped into an aging society. As the aging of the population quickens, the number of elderly people is becoming very large. Therefore, it is necessary to find good ways to deal with the problem.  According to traditional Chinese moral values, it is the sons or daughters who should take the responsibility of caring their elderly parents. The youth should not only look after their elderly parents in material terms but also understand their loneliness and do their best to spend more time with them.  But because the family plan has been carried out for many years in China, it is a common picture that a young couple has to support four elderly
      parents. This trend will reach its peak in coming years. The government is responsible for guaranteeing the basic living standards of the elderly and safeguard (保护) their legitimate (合法的) rights and interests and establish a multi-level old-age insurance system.

      15,My English Studies
      （我的英语学习）
        I have been learning English for more than twenty years. Recalling my English studies, I would like to share some good ways and some frustrations with you.  First, I am independent in English studies. Instead of waiting for the teacher to explain, I try to find the patterns and rules on my own.  Second, I am an active English learner. I never wait for a chance using English. I
      look for such a chance, and create a language environment by myself. I am willing to make mistakes and not afraid of losing face.  Try your best to enjoy the pleasure of English studies, bear in mind that “frustration gets you nowhere”
